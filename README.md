# Railway Reservation System using Python Tkinter
🚆 Railway Reservation System – Simplifying Ticket Booking with Python! 

I worked on a Railway Reservation System, a Python-based project designed to make railway ticket booking hassle-free! Instead of waiting in long queues at the ticket counter, this system provides a smooth, user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter and powered by an SQLite database for efficient data management.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ User Authentication – Secure login with pre-defined credentials.
✅ Train Search & Booking – Select source, destination, date, and class (1A, 2A, 3A).
✅ Automated PNR Generation – Each booking gets a unique PNR number.
✅ Instant Ticket Receipt – View and store booking details.
✅ Easy Cancellation – Cancel a ticket using the PNR number.
